# Fight Night Discord Bot

A small, focused Discord bot that posts MMA fight-night updates to your server. It uses a modular source system (ESPN for UFC today) so as more orgs are added, the bot can fetch from different providers. Pick your org, choose a channel, and get one clean post per event.

## Why
I'm lazy and tired of manually posting fight-night events in my Discord server. I announce fights and share my picks, and keeping up with those event posts is a chore â€” so I made this bot to announce the fight nights for me.

## What
- Notifies a configured channel on fight nights for your chosen org (UFC supported now).
- Lets you select the org and destination channel for posts.
- Provides a quick "next event" lookup command.
- Tracks last-posted event per guild and per org to prevent duplicates.
- Optional announcement delivery that publishes in Announcement channels.

## Features
- Org selection per guild (UFC supported today; others later).
- Notifications are OFF by default; you must set an org before enabling.
- Channel routing to a specific, configurable channel.
- Event-day posting with at-most-once delivery per event/guild/org.
- Optional announcement mode: publish messages from Announcement channels to follower servers (falls back to regular messages when unsupported).
- Next-event lookup via slash command.

## Commands
Representative commands (names/args may vary slightly based on current implementation):
- `/set-org org:<ufc>`: Choose the organization (currently UFC only). Required before enabling notifications.
- `/set-channel channel:<#channel>`: Pick the channel for notifications.
- `/notify on|off`: Enable or disable fight-night posts for this guild (requires org set; default is off).
- `/events state:<on|off>`: Enable or disable creating Discord Scheduled Events the day before an event (requires org set; bot needs Manage Events).
- `/set-delivery mode:<message|announcement>`: Choose regular messages or announcements. Announcement mode only applies when the target channel is an Announcement channel and the bot has permission to publish; otherwise it falls back to a normal message.
- `/next-event`: Show the next event for the selected org.
- `/set-run-hour hour:<0-23>`: Set the daily notification hour (guild timezone).
- `/set-tz tz:<Region/City>`: Set the guild timezone (IANA name).
- `/status`: Show current settings for this guild.
- `/help`: Show available commands and usage.

Dev-only (registered only when `GUILD_ID` is set):
- `/create-event`: [dev] Create a Discord Scheduled Event for the next org event (requires Manage Events on the guild; used for testing scheduled-events behavior).
- `/create-announcement`: [dev] Post the next event message+embed now via the notifier path (requires Manage Channels in the target channel). Useful to preview the exact notifier output in Discord without waiting for the scheduler or event day.

## Getting Started
- Set org: run `/set-org org:<ufc>`.
- Pick channel: run `/set-channel channel:<#your-channel>`.
- Optional timezone: run `/set-tz tz:<Region/City>` (defaults to `TZ` env).
- Enable notifications: run `/notify on` (notifications are off by default).
- Verify: run `/next-event` to see the next event for your org.
  - For a full preview of the daily post, use the dev command `/create-announcement` in your dev guild.

Notes
- Posts run daily at the configured hour (per guild via `/set-run-hour`, default from `RUN_AT`) in your guild's timezone; event-day posts only. Minutes are ignored.
- You must set an org before enabling notifications.
- Announcement mode works only in Announcement (News) channels. The bot will send the message normally and then attempt to publish it (crosspost). If the channel type is not Announcement or publishing fails, the message remains as a regular post.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Go 1.25
- Discord: `discordgo` slash commands and interactions
- Sources: modular provider interface; UFC via ESPN scraping client
- Scheduling: daily scheduler, IANA timezone via `TZ`
- State: persistent store for guild config and last-posted
- Config: environment-first with `.env` via `godotenv`
- Tests: standard `testing` with table-driven cases

## Project Structure
- `cmd/fight-night-bot/main.go`: Entrypoint; wires config, Discord, sources manager, scheduler; graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- `internal/config`: Loads env (`.env` via `godotenv`), defaults, required vars.
- `internal/discord`: Slash commands and daily notifier scheduling/handlers.
- `internal/sources`: Provider interfaces and registry for org-specific event sources.
- `internal/espn`: Scraper client used by the UFC provider.
- `internal/state`: Guild settings and last-posted state (SQLite).
- `.env` (local only) and state storage (see `internal/state`).

## Database Migrations

- Engine: SQLite via CGO (`github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`).
- Migrations: `golang-migrate` with embedded SQL, auto-run at boot.
  - Files live under `internal/migrate/migrations/` and are embedded into the binary.
  - On application startup, migrations run automatically before the DB is used.
  - This works well on Fly.io where `release_command` cannot access the volume.

Adding a migration:

- Create two files with the next sequence number (e.g., `0002_add_new_table.up.sql` and `0002_add_new_table.down.sql`) in `internal/migrate/migrations/`.
- Keep migrations deterministic and forward-only; use `IF NOT EXISTS` only when bootstrapping compatibility is required.
- Build and run the bot; it will apply the new migration on startup.

## Configuration
- Required:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord bot token
- Optional:
  - `GUILD_ID`: Dev guild for command registration
  - `RUN_AT`: Daily run time `HH:MM` (e.g., `16:00`). Only the hour is used.
  - `TZ`: IANA timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`)
  - `DB_FILE`: SQLite database path (default `state.db`; Docker runtime defaults to `/data/bot.db`)
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` (default `info`)
  - `SENTRY_DSN`: Enable Sentry error reporting when set
  - `SENTRY_ENV`/`SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`: Optional environment name (default `production`)
  - `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`: Optional performance sample rate (e.g., `0.2`)

Example `.env`:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
GUILD_ID=123456789012345678
RUN_AT=16:00
TZ=America/New_York
LOG_LEVEL=info
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
# SENTRY_ENV=development
# SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.0
```

## Build, Run, Test
- Run locally: `go run ./cmd/fight-night-bot`
- Build binary: `go build -o bin/fight-night-bot ./cmd/fight-night-bot`
- Format/Vet: `go fmt ./... && go vet ./...`
- Tests: `go test -race -cover ./...`
  - Live ESPN integration tests are skipped by default; enable with `ESPN_LIVE=1` if you want to exercise network calls.
  - Notifier tests stub outbound Discord calls and pass under race and coverage.

## Deploy (Fly.io)
Target: containerized deploy with a small persistent volume for SQLite.

- Secrets:
  - `fly secrets set DISCORD_TOKEN=...`
  - Optional: `fly secrets set TZ=America/New_York RUN_AT=16:00 USER_AGENT='your-agent'`
- Volume (for SQLite):
  - `fly volumes create data --size 1 --region <region>`
  - Mounted at `/data` via `fly.toml`; Dockerfile defaults `DB_FILE=/data/bot.db` already
- Dockerfile: multi-stage build on Go 1.25, copy binary to a minimal runtime, run as non-root, includes time zone data.
- `fly.toml`: define `[env]` for `TZ`/`RUN_AT` and add `[[mounts]]` for `/data`.

## Roadmap
- Sources: add more orgs (Bellator, PFL, ONE) via providers; health checks and fallbacks per provider.
- Tests: add more tests and increase coverage.

## Contributing
- Try it in a dev guild and share behavior logs or screenshots.
- Suggest command UX and defaults (times, mentions, channel selection).
- Report ESPN payload quirks to harden parsing and messaging.
- PRs welcome: keep diffs focused; ensure `go fmt`, `go vet`, and tests pass.
